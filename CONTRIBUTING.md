Major changes may be rejected. Please open an issue first and if we decide you can help we will take it from there. This is a very small project, so I don't expect a lot of contributions.

Please remember to test the code you want to add. The code must pass existing tests, and if any test are changed, please give a very good reason why that change is necessary.
